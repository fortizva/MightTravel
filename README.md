## 💾 Database

The repository includes a sample SQLite database (`data/mighttravel.db`) containing **demo data** to showcase the system’s functionality.  

This allows the project to be run and explored immediately, without needing to populate the database manually by placing it in `%USERPROFILE%/sqlite_dbs/mighttravel.db`.  
  
> ⚠️ No sensitive or real user information is stored, the data is purely for demonstration purposes.
